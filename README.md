# Air-Pollution-Prediction
Overview

Did you know air pollution kills around 7 million people worldwide every year?
As per WHO data, 9 out of 10 people breathe air that contains higher levels of pollutants; and low-and-middle-income countries are at a threat of the highest exposures.
Air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate, right from smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home.
The combined effects of ambient and household air pollution causes about 7 million premature deaths every year.
These largely results in increased mortality from stroke, heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.

Current Scenario

As we know in recent years the pollution emitted per day has increased drastically, countries all around the world are taking up actions in order to tackle the rapid increase in pollution to avoid global warming.
Beijing’s pollution authority has collected data for the past 5 years and the data has been passed on to your client by the government of China.
The company calculates pollution using traditional or manual methods, so it needs a model to do the long process.
The target variable is PM2.5



Overall Analysis:
The exposure of PM2.5 is dependent on secondary gases, like
- Carbon Monoxide (cars, trucks and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels)
- SO2(burning of coal and oil)
- NO2 (emitted from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment)

Ozone depletion occurs when chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons—gases formerly found in aerosol spray cans and refrigerants—are released into the atmosphere. CFCs and halons cause chemical reactions that break down ozone molecules, reducing ozone's ultraviolet radiation-absorbing capacity.

Future Insights:

On Days when High Particle Levels are Expected, Take these Extra Steps to Reduce Pollution:

- Reduce the number of trips you take in your car.
- Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use.
- Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.
- Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.
- Modifying a production process to produce less waste.
- Using non-toxic or less toxic chemicals as cleaners, degreasers and other maintenance chemicals.
- Implementing water and energy conservation practices.
- Reusing materials such as drums and pallets rather than disposing of them as waste.
